      "2": "Oh no! 🦄 A unicorn wants a room, but every single room is taken! How can we possibly fit one more guest when infinity rooms are full? The hotel manager has a brilliant idea! Click 'Show the Magic!' 🪄",
      "3": "✨ **The Magic Happens!** Watch as every guest moves to the room with the next higher number! Guest in room 1→2, room 2→3, room 3→4, and so on! This frees up room 1! 🏠",
      "4": "🎉 **Success!** The unicorn gets room 1, and everyone else still has a room! This shows us something amazing about infinity - even when you have infinitely many things, you can sometimes still add more! Click 'Next Step' to learn more! 🏨✨",
      "5": "🎓 **You Did It!** You've learned that infinity + 1 = infinity! In math, this helps us understand how infinite sets work. Ready for a bigger challenge? Try the 'Bus Full of Guests' scenario! 🚌"

      "4": "🌟 **Incredible!** All 5 bus passengers get rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, while everyone else still has a room! We made space for 5 guests by being extra clever! Click 'Next Step'! 🎊",
      "5": "🧠 **Genius Level!** You've learned that infinity + 5 = infinity too! By doubling room numbers, we created infinite space! Ready for the ultimate challenge? Try 'Infinite Buses!' 🚌♾️"
